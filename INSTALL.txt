Echo Nest Remix - Install From Source

Introduction:

Here is how you install Remix from source on Mac, Windows, or Linux. This method is either for Linux users, "experts" or developers, people that may have their own versions of Python already installed, or people want to contribute to Remix in some way. If you're not one of those people, you most likely want one of the install packages on the main page, not this stuff.

Requirements:

Installing Remix from source requires:
-- python2.5-dev -- Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 with the headers
-- ffmpeg (only if you are on Linux)
-- python-numpy
-- A build environment, either XCode (mac), build-essential (gcc, Linux), Visual Studio Express or higher (Windows)

Steps

-- Install Numpy using the package manager of your choice, or from the web.
-- Install python2.5-dev using the package manager of your choice
-- Install build-essential using the package manager of your choice, get XCode, or get Visual Studio Express
-- If you are on Linux, you need to get ffmpeg if you don't already have it. Our distribution has builds for Mac and Windows, but not Linux. The best place to get a good build of ffmpeg with all the good codecs in it is the Debian Multimedia Repository. All you need to do is add the correct lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list file and then apt-get install ffmpeg. After installing ffmpeg, you need to make a symbolic link to it so that Remix knows where to find it:
    sudo ln -s `which ffmpeg` /usr/local/bin/en-ffmpeg
Note that the setup.py script also installs a version of ffmpeg on Mac and Windows called "en-ffmpeg" as well as the youtube-dl script. The pysoundtouch and pydirac libraries are also compiled and copied over. The version of ffmpeg we install is not modified in any way but includes various useful codecs and is confirmed to work well with Remix. If you have your own version of ffmpeg, feel free to use it but it needs to be symlinked to en-ffmpeg (we do this to not trample on existing versions of ffmpeg a user may have installed.)

Test It:

To test Python and Numpy, try the following:
    python
    import numpy
To test ffmpeg, try:
    en-ffmpeg

Install:

If those give no errors, you're ready to get remix installed:

-- Clone the source code from github:
    git clone https://github.com/echonest/remix.git
-- Initialize and update the pyechonest submodule:
    git submodule update --init
-- Install remix using setup.py:

sudo python setup.py install

Once that's done, you can visit http://echonest.github.com/remix/ to get an API key and run some examples!
