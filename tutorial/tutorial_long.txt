Welcome to the Big Tutorial for Echo Nest Remix.  
    "...it makes each song its own API..." - Adam Lindsay

Echo Nest Remix gives you access, in code, to the musical parameters that define a song.  
You can get each bar of the song in a list, look at the timbre data for each beat, 
mix and timestretch entire songs, and so on.  This tutorial is going to go into  detail on how Remix does that.  
If you want a lighter intro, you can check the smaller tutorial for Remix, or look at the included examples, or look some things that people have done with remix.
